\section*{Preface}

These are dense notes on \textit{combustion} concepts. They start from the preliminary notions that are needed in understanding the combustion language. Next, they introduce the elements of \textit{thermodynamics} relevant to the study of combustion, and finally present the governing \textit{differential relations} for \textit{reactive flows} in various systems.

These notes are collected from numerous sources from which I studied combustion theory, the main that are ought to be mentioned are: [\ref{bib:turns}] and [\ref{bib:pitsch}].

If you would like to see computational examples that support concepts presented here, I encourage you to take a look at my other document \textit{Computational examples in transport phenomena with Python}.

\section{Basic concepts}

\subsection{Species}

A \textit{species} is a general name for any chemical compound that takes role in a chemical reaction. In the context of combustion, the most encountered species are for instance: CO2, CO, H2O, O2, N2, etc.

\subsection{Species mass fraction}

A species mass fraction is a ratio between mass $m_i$ of a particular $i$-th species in the mixture and the total mass of the mixture $m_{TOT}$:

\begin{equation}
Y_i = \frac{m_i}{m_{TOT}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Species mole fraction}

A species molar fraction is the ratio between number of moles $N_i$ of a particular $i$-th species in the mixture and the total number of moles of the mixture $N_{TOT}$:

\begin{equation}
\chi_i = \frac{N_i}{N_{TOT}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mass-basis and molar-basis}

In combustion, we encounter both \textit{mass-basis} and \textit{molar-basis} quantities. According to [\ref{bib:pitsch}], the mass-basis is useful because mass is conserved and molar-basis is useful because chemical reactions are written per-molar basis.

\subsection{Air-to-fuel ratio}

Air-to-fuel ratio is the ratio between mass of air $m_{air}$ and mass of fuel $m_{fuel}$ in the mixture.

The stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio:

\begin{equation}
AF_{st} = \Big( \frac{m_{air}}{m_{fuel}} \Big)_{st}
\end{equation}

And a general air-to-fuel ratio for any mixture:

\begin{equation}
AF = \frac{m_{air}}{m_{fuel}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Equivalence ratio}

The equivalence ratio is the ratio between stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio and an actual air-to-fuel ratio:

\begin{equation}
\phi = \frac{AF_{st}}{AF}
\end{equation}

When the real mixture has excess air (it is a \textbf{lean} mixture), $\phi < 1$. For \textbf{rich} mixtures $\phi > 1$.

\subsection{Mixture fraction}

In general, when we create an unburnt mixture from fuel and oxidizer streams, the \textit{fuel stream} is composed of fuel and other fuel-impurities and the \textit{oxidizer stream} is composed of oxidizer and other oxidizer-impurities. The mass of the total fuel stream is $m_1$ and the mass of the total oxidizer stream is $m_2$.

The mixture fraction is the ratio between mass of the fuel stream to the total mass of the unburnt mixture:

\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{m_1}{m_{u, TOT}} = \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{mixture-fraction.png}
\caption{Fuel-oxidizer stream system.}			
\label{fig:mixture-fraction}
\end{figure}

We may also define the mass fraction of fuel in the unburnt mixture:

\begin{equation}
Y_{u, F} = \frac{m_F}{m_{u, TOT}} = \frac{m_F}{m_1 + m_2}
\end{equation}

and mass fraction of fuel in the fuel stream:

\begin{equation}
Y_{1, F} = \frac{m_F}{m_1}
\end{equation}

These two quantities are clearly related to each other via the mixture fraction:

\begin{equation}
Y_{u, F} = \frac{m_F}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{m_F}{m_1} \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} = Y_{1, F} Z
\end{equation}

Similar reasoning can be done for the oxidizer in the oxidizer stream.





\subsection{Adiabatic flame temperature}

The adiabatic flame temperature (AdFT) is the temperature of combustion products if the combustion happens without heat exchange with the surroundings. It thus represents the maximum theoretical temperature for a given combustion system.

\subsubsection{Constant pressure AdFT}



\subsubsection{Constant volume AdFT}







\subsection{Dissociation}

The dissociation of a species is the process of spliting that species into smaller particles: either atoms or other species such as ions or radicals.

\section{Energy considerations}

\subsection{Equations of state}

The equation of state owes its name to the fact that it relates variables describing \textit{state} of the system. Among those are: pressure $P$, volume $V$ and temperature $T$.

\begin{equation}
PV = mRT
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Calorific equation of state}

On the other hand, the calorific equation of state relates internal energy with the state variables.

\begin{equation}
du = \Big( \frac{\partial u}{\partial T} \Big)_V dT + \Big( \frac{\partial u}{\partial V} \Big)_T dV
\end{equation}

\subsection{Thermodynamic potentials}





\subsection{Enthalpy of formation}

The \textit{enthalpy of formation} for a given species is the amount of energy required to form this species from elements in a given state (described by the temperature and pressure).


\subsection{Enthalpy of combustion}

The \textit{enthalpy of combustion} is the amount of heat produced by the combustion process. It is the difference between enthalpy of products and enthalpy of reactants.

\subsection{First law of thermodynamics}

The first law of thermodynamics states, that the total change in energy of the system is equal to the difference of the heat added to the system and work done by the system on the surroundings.



\subsection{Second law of thermodynamics}

The second law of thermodynamics states, that the total entropy of an isolated system can never be negative.

\subsection{Clausius-Clapeyron equation}



\section{Species transport}



\subsection{1-D species transport}

The mechanical transport of species can be twofold: due to a bulk motion of the fluid and/or due to molecular diffusion. Below, we consider one-dimensional binary transport.

\subsubsection{1-D diffusion from Fick's law}

One way to model molecular diffusion is to use Fick's law. It states that the mass flow rate is proportional to the concentration gradient with the constant $-\rho \mathcal{D}$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \dot{m}_{i, diff}}{dA} = - \rho \mathcal{D} \frac{d Y_i}{dx}
\end{equation}

In the 1-D case, the quantity $\mathcal{D}$ is called \textit{binary diffusivity} and its units are $m^2/s$. In the above equation, $\dot{m}_{i, diff}$ is the mass flux of species due to diffusion, $\rho$ is the density and $Y$ is the concentration of species.

\subsubsection{1-D bulk flow}

The bulk transport of species A is simply the fraction of the total mixture mass flux that contributes to the transport of species A. That fraction is equal to the mass fraction $Y_A$ of species A.

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \dot{m}_{i, bulk}}{dA} = Y_i \frac{d \dot{m}_{TOT}}{d A}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{1-D binary transport}

For a one-dimensional, binary diffusion (diffusion between two species A and B) we have the mass flow rate of species A per unit area described as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \dot{m}_A }{dA} = Y_A \frac{d \dot{m}_{TOT}}{d A} - \rho \mathcal{D}_{AB} \frac{dY_A}{dx}
\end{equation}\label{eq:1d-bin-diff}

where $\dot{m}_{TOT} = \dot{m}_A + \dot{m}_B$.

It is worth mentioning here, that the above result does not yet contain information about possible chemical reactions in which species A and B might take part. The eq.(\ref{eq:1d-bin-diff}) describes only the pure transport of species.

\subsubsection{1-D species conservation}

Differential relations for one-dimensional species conservation can be derived by considering a 1-D control volume $\Delta x$. We now assume that the species can react, and so the mass of a particular species within the control volume can change due to transport, as well as due to creation/destruction of species in a chemical reaction. 

The change of mass of a species A in the control volume can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d m_{A, CV} }{dt} = \Big[ \frac{d \dot{m}_A}{d A} A \Big]_x - \Big[ \frac{d \dot{m}_A}{d A} A \Big]_{x + \Delta x} + r_A V
\end{equation}

where $r_A$ is the mass production rate of species A per unit volume. For further considerations we will call this term the \textit{source term}.

Substituting $m_{A, CV} = Y_A m_{CV} = Y_A \rho A \Delta x$ we get:

\begin{equation}
A \Delta x \frac{d \rho Y_{A} }{dt} = \Big[ \frac{d \dot{m}_A}{d A} A \Big]_x - \Big[ \frac{d \dot{m}_A}{d A} A \Big]_{x + \Delta x} + r_A A \Delta x
\end{equation}

Using the relation for 1-D binary diffusion from eq.(\ref{eq:1d-bin-diff}), and dividing by $A \Delta x$ we get:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d \rho Y_{A} }{dt} = & \frac{1}{\Delta x}\Big[ Y_A \frac{d \dot{m}_{TOT}}{d A} - \rho \mathcal{D}_{AB} \frac{dY_A}{dx} \Big]_x \\
& - \frac{1}{\Delta x} \Big[ Y_A \frac{d \dot{m}_{TOT}}{d A} - \rho \mathcal{D}_{AB} \frac{dY_A}{dx} \Big]_{x + \Delta x} \\
& + r_A
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Finally taking the limit as $\Delta x \rightarrow 0$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \rho Y_{A} }{dt} = - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big[ Y_A \frac{d \dot{m}_{TOT}}{d A} - \rho \mathcal{D}_{AB} \frac{dY_A}{dx} \Big] + r_A
\end{equation}






\subsection{Source terms}

\subsection{3-D species transport}

We now extend our previous relations to the 3-D case.

\subsubsection{Reaction rate considerations}


\section{Chemical kinetics}

\subsection{Reaction rate}






\section{Extension to thermal equations}




\section{Chemical reactors}

The quantities that we are interested in finding for a chemical reactor system are temperature function $T(t)$, as well as the species concentrations $[X_i] = [X_i](t)$.

\subsection{Constant pressure, fixed mass reactor}

We look for the solution to two differential equations:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d T(t)}{dt} = f([X_i], T)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{d [X_i](t)}{dt} = f([X_i], T)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Temperature}

We start by applying the first law of thermodynamics to the reactor:

\begin{equation}
\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{dq}{dt} - \frac{dw}{dt}
\end{equation}

We then substitute for the values of internal energy (the enthalpy equation) and work (assuming the only work done by the system is in moving the piston):

\begin{equation}
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{du}{dt} + P \frac{dv}{dt} \rightarrow \frac{du}{dt} = \frac{dh}{dt} - P \frac{dv}{dt}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
w = Pv \rightarrow \frac{d w}{dt} = P \frac{dv}{dt} 
\end{equation}

Substitution gives:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{dh}{dt}
\end{equation}

We would like the temperature and species fractions to appear in the equation.

\subsubsection{Species concentrations}
